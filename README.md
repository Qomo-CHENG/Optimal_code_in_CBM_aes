<h1 align="center">Open-source for Attack-based Evaluation on Code-based Masking</h1>

This repo is created for the open-source of the paper `Information Leakage in Code-based Masking: A Systematic Evaluation by Higher-Order Attacks`, which has been submitted to *IEEE XXXX*. All the data and scripts would allow other researchers to verify and reproduce our results.

We present optimal linear codes in IPM, SSS-based masking, etc. 
**Note that the irreducible polynomial is g(X) = X^8 + X^4 + X^3 + X +1, which is the one used in AES.**
